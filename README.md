# Building a Server from Scratch

This is an exercise to walk students through building an express/knex server from scratch. Some migrations as generic as they are solid. Team Sunday Mike is known for its indefatigable hunger for knowledge. Great questions were asked. There were asides. Minds expanded. Notes were taken that will stand the test of time. You wish you were there.
